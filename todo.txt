*** questions
when do I keep a function/state in context and when do I keep it within a component

  //why brackets+/*? Stepping into state?
  // why can i use offense: but have to use dot notation and not just use offense: offense + 1
  const handleTeamAmount = () => {
    if (rosterLocked === false) {
      setRosterLocked(true)
      finalRoster.forEach((player) => {
        if (player.team === 'Offense') {
          setTeamAmount((teamAmount) => ({
            ...teamAmount,
            offense: teamAmount.offense + 1,
          }))
        }



        why do functions trigger when a page renders
        if do not have an empty function ()=> in front of them? even when written without()
